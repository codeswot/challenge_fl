This README provides an overview of the Shoe Shopping App project developed using Flutter. Please note that this project is not fully completed, and certain features and components may be missing due to time constraints. Below are some details about what I would have done with more time to enhance the project.

## Project Overview

The Shoe Shopping App is a mobile application built with Flutter for both Android and iOS platforms. It allows users to browse and shop for a variety of shoes, view product details, read and filter reviews, add items to the cart, and proceed to checkout. The app integrates with Firebase for data storage, and it has basic functionality to display shoes and product details.

### What I Would Have Done with More Time

#### 1. Complete UI and Enhance User Experience

- **Filter Page**: Implement the filter page, allowing users to filter shoes by brands, price range, and sorting options. Ensure a user-friendly and responsive design.
- **Reviews Page**: Develop the reviews page where users can view all reviews and filter them by the number of stars. Implement proper pagination or infinite scrolling for large review datasets.
- **User Feedback**: Add loaders, notifications, and feedback mechanisms throughout the app to provide a seamless and responsive user experience.

#### 2. Backend Integration and Firebase Function

- **Firebase Functions**: I Would Have Create Firebase Functions or similar services but i had a contraints against my card not working in other to upgrade to Blaze(pay as you go plan) plan.


#### 3. Code Quality and Testing

- **Unit Tests**: Implement unit tests to ensure the reliability of critical app functions. Test components, data retrieval, and data manipulation to catch potential issues early in development.

- **Code Cleanup**: Refactor and optimize code for better readability, maintainability, and adherence to coding standards. Add comments where necessary to explain complex logic.

#### 4. Enhanced Features

- **Authentication**: Implement user authentication to provide personalized experiences, such as saving user preferences and order history.
- **Favorites**: Allow users to add products to their favorites list for easy access.
- **Search Functionality**: Add a search feature to quickly find products by name, brand, or keyword.

- **Payment Integration**: Incorporate real payment integration with a payment gateway for a complete shopping experience.

- **Localization**: Add support for multiple languages to reach a wider audience.
- **User Feedback and Reporting**: Implement mechanisms for users to submit feedback or report issues within the app.



## Conclusion

While this challenge is currently incomplete, with additional time and resources, it has the potential to become a fully functional and user-friendly e-commerce application. The outlined enhancements and features would contribute to a more polished and engaging user experience, during the short time i hade i enjoyed the challenge and tried my very best to write quality good code, although by skill with bloc is not that super i had fun handeling it.
